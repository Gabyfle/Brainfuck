# Brainfuck
A Brainfuck compiler, written in **OCaml**

## What is "Brainfuck" ?
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language developed by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. The first particularity of this language is that it contains only 8 instructions that allow, in theory, to create any program (it is said to be Turing-complete). For more information, visit the Wikipedia page of the Brainfuck language: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck - Wikipedia</a></p>

## What is this ?
<p style="text-align: justify;">This repository contains a compiler written entirely in OCaml. The ultimate goal would be to be able to integrate the compiler into other projects so that he can use Brainfuck as he sees fit.</p>

## Performances
### Hello World!
* Code: [Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello_World!)
* Compile time: 
* 


## Compiling your assembly code

### Requirements
* [Netwide Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/)
* A device running a x86-32 or x86-64 architecture
* A POSIX operating system

### Command line
To compile the assembly code that Brainfuck produces, type the following in your Terminal :

```
nasm -felf32 <your_file>.asm
ld -melf_i386 <your_file>.o -o <program_name>
```

Then, to execute it, simply run:

```
./<program_name>
```

## Parser feature
This compiler includes a very simple parser that will detect broken *Brainfuck* code. Here is some examples of how does it tell you that you made a mistake :

* **Example 1 :** you forgot to close a loop

*Input :*
```brainfuck
++++++++++[>+++++++
```
*Output :*
```
Parser.Syntax_Error("No matching ']' found for '[' at char 11 in loop 1")
```

* **Example 2 :** you added a `]` that does not match any loop

*Input :*
```brainfuck
++++++++++>+++++++]
```
*Output :*
```
Parser.Syntax_Error("No matching '[' found for ']' at char 19")
```

## Optimization goal
* Optimize loops
* Optimize dead code
