# Brainfuck
A Brainfuck interpreter and compiler, written in **OCaml**

## What is "Brainfuck" ?
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language developed by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. The first particularity of this language is that it contains only 8 instructions that allow, in theory, to create any program (it is said to be Turing-complete). For more information, visit the Wikipedia page of the Brainfuck language: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck - Wikipedia</a></p>

## What is this ?
<p style="text-align: justify;">This repository contains an interpreter written entirely in OCaml as well as a compiler. The ultimate goal would be to be able to integrate the interpreter into other projects so that he can use Brainfuck as he sees fit.</p>
